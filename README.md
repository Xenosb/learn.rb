# learn.rb

The goal of this project is to provide a set of handouts and assignments over
the course of which anybody should learn the basics of Ruby and Ruby on Rails
application development.

## How to use this

This course consists of handouts and assignments, it's written in the style of
[Land of Lisp](https://nostarch.com/lisp.htm) meaning it teaches through
observing and problem solving (one could say it takes a Stoic approach to
teaching).

The idea is to give pupils handouts which drive them through a problem and gives
them examples and solutions. At the end of the handout the student is
presented with a problem that incorporates all previous knowledge from the
handout without a solution - this problem will be solved by student and
submitted for a review by the teaching staff.

The pace at which handouts are given and assignments collected is completely
arbitrary and can be changed to your liking. This course was designed with a
weekly schedule in mind and with mid-week consultations with the pupils.

If you want to go through the course on your own, without a teacher, then you
can reference the assignment solutions, but that is less useful than working
through a problem with somebody more experienced.
