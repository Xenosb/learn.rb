# Class communication

To help you organize your time and remove stress of asking questions multiple
communication channels were established. Our warm advice would be to subscribe
and/or join them now if you already haven't.

## Class calendar

Calendar will be populated with dates of all consultations, homework due dates
and other important dates. 

You can view it and add it to your calendars via this [link](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/b/1?cid=a3NldC5vcmdfOWgxYnI5cGhwbmtxcmFsN3VmZHNwcDU0NWtAZ3JvdXAuY2FsZW5kYXIuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbQ)

members will have automatic access to calendar.

If you are attending the class and aren't receivng mails from the group please
